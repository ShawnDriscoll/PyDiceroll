**What's New with PyDiceroll 3.2?**
===================================

Parsing
-------

The roll() function has improved parsing that allows for spaces from other program sources. Error-checking understands this
and will even check for negative numbers of dice. This improved feature works whether **PyDiceroll** is being used in a Python
program or at a CMD prompt.


Refactored for Python 3.9
-------------------------

**PyDiceroll's** code has been updated from 2.5 to 3.9 standards.


The D5 Die
----------

The D5 has been added to **PyDiceroll**. It is basically a D10 divided by 2, much like how the D3 die is a D6 that is divided by 2.


New in PyDiceroll 3.2.1
-----------------------

New D44 and D88 rolls have been added. These are table rolls, similar to the D66 roll.
