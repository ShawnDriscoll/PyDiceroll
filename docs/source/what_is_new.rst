**What's New with PyDiceroll 3.2?**
===================================

Parsing
-------

The roll() function has improved parsing that allows for spaces from other program sources. Error-checking understands this
and will even check for negative numbers of dice. This improved feature works whether **PyDiceroll** is being used in a Python
program or at a CMD prompt.


Refactored for Python 3.9
-------------------------

**PyDiceroll's** code has been updated from 2.5 to 3.9 standards.
