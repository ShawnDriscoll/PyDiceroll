**Alternate PyDiceroll Distributions**
======================================

Often times, the **PyDiceroll** module is found in other formats. You may already
have a copy of **PyDiceroll** that was distributed with another program you're using.

Besides its common ``.py`` format, **PyDiceroll** can be found in a ``.pyd`` format as
well. This format is packaged as a dynamic link library, and will work the same way as
the ``.py`` format. The format is typically bundled with the software that it was designed
for.

.. Note::
   The ``.pyd`` format can only be imported and will not execute at a CMD prompt.
