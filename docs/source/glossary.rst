.. glossary::

   ASM
     Rarely is Assembly language programming done by hand. Rumors say it will make
     a huge comeback, once people stop using compilers.
   
   80286
     A CPU used by home computers in the mid-1980s.
     
   BASIC09
     A structured BASIC programming language dialect developed by Microware
     and Motorola for the then-new Motorola 6809 CPU and released in 1980. It was
     the best computer programming language until Python was invented.
	 
   Bugs
     Coding errors (logic, run-time, or compile-time) that need fixing (debugging).
     
   CMD
     Command Prompt (CMD) is a command line interpreter program available
     in Windows 10, 8, 7, Vista, and XP. Command Prompt is similar
     in appearance to MS-DOS.
	 
   COBOL
     A programming language that did not see the coming days of Python. For it
     was already a dead language.

   compiler
     Converts the long-winded and verbose code that people type into something that
     computers can work with. See ASM.

   concatenation
     String concatenation is the operation of joining character strings
     end-to-end. For example, the concatenation of "iron" and "man"
     is "ironman".
     
   C
     A computer programming language used to write a better computer programming language called Python.
     
   CPython
     CPython is the default, most widely used implementation of
     the Python programming language. It is written in C and is typically
     found running on Windows and Linux. C++ programers will never admit to using
     Python.
     
   D100
     A 100-sided die. A sphere, basically. Rolled with caution.
     
   debug
     The process of finding and resolving of defects that prevent
     correct operation of computer software or a system.
     
   dice
     Small throwable objects with multiple resting positions, used for
     generating random numbers. Dice are suitable as gambling devices
     for games like craps and are also used in tabletop games.

   errors
     Bugs that need to be squashed.
     
   FORTRAN
     A computer programming language used to play Star Trek games in the 1970s. It
     has survived death-blows from Python over the years.
     
   game
     An activity engaged in for diversion or amusement. For computer games, it
     means no sweating.
	 
   GitHub
     It's where we will all be uploaded someday.

   i7
     A CPU for making your Python code run as fast as C code.
     
   IDE
     An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software
     application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer
     programmers for software development. The most popular one right now is
     Microsoft Visual Studio Code.
	 
   import
     The import command in Python is the same as the load command in Basic09. It's one
     of the most over-used commands in Python. Python can import code from the future.
    
   integer
     An integer is what is more commonly known as a whole number.
     It may be positive, negative, or the number zero, but it must be whole.

   interpreter
     All of the best programming languages are interpreted. People get things done quicker
     when they don't have to compile. Less interruptions.
     
   log
     A log is a file that records events that occur as software runs.
     Logging is the act of keeping a log. In the simplest case, messages are
     written to a single logfile.
     
   module
     A module is a part of a program. Programs are composed of one
     or more independently developed modules that are not combined
     until the program is linked.
     
   no dice
     Used to refuse a request or indicate no chance of success.

   NPC
     A game character that wants to kill a player character.

   Pascal
     A programming language that Python helped kill.
	 
   pip
     A package installer for Python. It will install packages from the Interweb (a.k.a. iCloud). It's
     the way most people install Python modules uploaded by other people these days.

   print()
     Always remember to use **(** and **)** when using a print function. Them's the rules now.
	 
   PyDiceroll
     A Python module available from this `GitHub <https://github.com/ShawnDriscoll/pydiceroll/>`__ repository.

   PyQt
     The best GUI for Python. It is the Python version of Qt, which is the C version of the GUI.
	 
   Python 3.9+
     A version of Python, used the-world-over, that PyDiceroll was written for.
     
   rabbit hole
     Used to refer to a bizarre, confusing, or nonsensical situation
     or environment, typically one from which it is difficult to extricate oneself.
     
   random
     The lack of pattern or predictability in events. A random sequence
     of events, symbols or steps has no order and does not follow an
     intelligible pattern or combination. Individual random events are
     by definition unpredictable, but in many cases the frequency of
     different outcomes over a large number of events (or "trials") is predictable.

   RPG
     Role-playing games use dice. PyDiceroll makes attempts at rolling the dice for the
     players and for the NPCs.

   Sphinx
     The Python software used to publish this much-needed operations manual.
     
   string
     A string is a contiguous sequence of symbols or values, such as
     a character string (a sequence of characters) or a binary
     digit string (a sequence of binary values).
     
   your own code
     Your own code is a Python program that you have already written to make calls
     to the ``roll()`` function.
